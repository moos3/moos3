Who am I ? Well I'm a DevOps Engineer that has always dreamed about doing the AT as a section hike. I have been given a oppurnity to do a thru-hike instead. So I'm going to be hiking two weeks at a time, coming out for a week for work. During that week of working, i'm going to be posting about my journey here. 

Stats:
Role: Dad, with 2 kids
Plan: Leave Apirl 1-ish, hike 2100+ miles of the AT. 

Equpiment List:
coming soon!

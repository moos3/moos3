So I'm starting to get in the final prep-stages for the AT. I orginally was going to section hike it. But I decided last night just do it as a thru-hike. So here we go. I started building my lists for things I need to do before I go. I'll be posting more on that as time gets closure. I have to thank my employer for the support and allowing me to do this crazy adventure in a way to stay employed and focused on it.
